# supr:mon

suprmon is a reimagined version of the classic status bar, displayed on a dedicated hardware device. It acts as a control center by using LEDs to visualize system status and vital information — perfect for those who prefer no bar on the screen, but instead a separate display with a vintage style.

After that, they are reset and the reserved system bar returns to its normal state.

supr:mon uses supr:light to communicate with supr:signal in order to manage what is displayed on Atom Matrix.
